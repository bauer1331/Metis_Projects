She looked very confused by this information and then preceded to say \"but like that's not a thing is it\" and I was all ready to get all offended and give a speech about differing sexuality and shit like that! Seeing the look on my face she quickly added \"but in plants asexual reproduction is where they reproduce with themselves\" then she paused and leant in slightly and genuinely said completely deadpan \"can you reproduce by yourself?!?\" ! I died right there ! I laughed so hard but the story ends well coz I then explained that wasn't my secret super power and she now knows what asexuality is! This is quite a funny story in my opinion but also highlights, in my view, how crucial education and awareness is and how important honesty and openness is from those asexuals or ACE community members who feel comfortable speaking about it. \n",
