(points to chocolate in my hand)\\nand that was the start of a beautiful friendship and set the stage for all our interactions. she is now one of my queerplatonic partners and is still just as blunt as ever. most of the discrimination i've experienced has been ignorance based. it's usually me explaining asexuality, them asking inappropriate questions, me having to answer most of them and then them making a statement that  demeans my ability to make decisions about my mind and body.\\nhowever, i think the worst one was actually from an lgbt group. the very first one i decided to join. towards the end of my second year of university i met a girl that i got into a conversation with about sexuality and lgbt came up. i found out that she was the president of the lgbt group and that she was pansexual. up until this point i'd been hesitant to join. i'd only known the lgbt movement to be about the idea of sexual freedom and i had no interest in being in a place surrounded by people talking about gay sex instead of people talking about straight sex which was the norm of my uni life up until then. she told about how it was a safe space for all sexualities, how they had educational evenings and that they were more likely to go to a pub quiz or lazer tag than go out drinking to pull people. those last two weeks of term were amazing and i was really looking forward to the next year where i'd try to be a lot more sociable and actually make more friends who understood.\\nthe next year someone new had become president and the qirl who'd first convinced me to join had graduated along with chunk of the committee. i re-registered again anyway hoping that they'd carry on with the same stuff. i was added to the necessary social groups and told the date of the first meeting. it was horrible. everybody introduced themselves: name, orientation, correct pronoun, etc. when it was my turn i actually heard a few people scoff at my orientation which certainly put a dent in my confidence. i spent the rest of the evening fielding inappropriate questions, derogative language and  being shunned when attempting to make conversation. understandably i went home that night feeling like, well, sh*t, really. the next day i found that i had been deleted from the social groups and that i was no longer a member of the lgbt society. sufficient to say, i did not feel great for the next few months. it took a few years but the memory of those two weeks was still with me and so i tried again with a different lgbt group, especially now that i am so much more comfortable with who i am. definitely wasn't a regret this time. ; understanding. or if not that, open-mindedness. ; ;\",\n",

told all of my closest friends and several of my work colleagues and uni classmates who i consider friends. aside from some confusion due to many people not being aware of what asexuality and romanticism are, most of them were unsurprised and said things like 'fair enough' or 'that makes sense'. i have never had a specifically negative reaction from anyone who was not a stranger or very slight acquaintance. one of my friends, after discussing with our mutual friend whether i would mind or not, asked me a lot of questions about what it was like and how i knew. i don't think he really understands in the sense that he can't imagine it just like i can't imagine sexual attraction (well, kind of in a 3rd person kind of way but not really) but i was happy that he wanted to know more and glad to have a chance to explain since many people misunderstand. i have noticed that people can react in the same way they do when i say i don't drink, eat meat or go clubbing. although i am quite happy for other people to do all of these things and simply do not personally want to do them myself, people often react either my downplaying the amount they do them ('oh, well, we hardly eat any meat, no red meat, we're basically vegetarian' 'yeah, i don't drink either, just socially') or by getting defensive and angry. they see the fact that i don't do something as a judgement on them doing it even though it isn't. one of my friends who is muslim also gets this very often. similarly i think people feel they either have to downplay how much sex means to them as though i will think they're slutty or shallow otherwise (which i don't. i am no more deep or moral than anyone else, i simply have a different orientation) or start saying defensively that people have to have sex. as i have said though i don't get reactions like that very often at all and especially not from girls who seem generally to be more understanding/accepting. i only really tell people about my asexuality if it actually comes up but i did post about it on facebook recently for coming out day with many positive responses. i have never felt that it causes people to treat me differently exactly. there were always people at school who teased me for not being interested in boys but in a more general way which encompassed be not wearing makeup, not caring about fashion much when i was young and generally only being interested in fantasy books and folk music and doing 'tomboy'ish things like rock climbing and climbing trees. identifying as asexual is quite a recent thing for me so it hasn't really had a chance to affect my career/education/housing in anyway. i think it has affected me socially my whole life because people couldn't always appreciate or accept my point of view but, as with the bullying, that was part of a much bigger picture including all my different interests and like anyone else, asexual or otherwise, i have simply moved away from those who judge me and towards like-minded people. i am of course very lucky that i have been able to easily find such people at home, school, university and work. just knowing that i am a thing which is real i guess. going on tumblr and seeing so many people just talking about it casually was absolutely the best feeling. it made me feel like i was normal (so far as anyone is normal…i'm not exactly conventional but you know what i mean). before the time when my dad (briefly) suggested that i shouldn't tell people i was asexual in case they treated me differently i found it hard to understand why people wanted to be part of communities based on orientation but i was very glad then to be able to talk to my friend (who is bisexual but very knowledgeable and accepting about all sorts of saga things) and have her agree that he was being unreasonable and back me up. i understood then why people sought community support because i have learnt so much in terms of academia and also morality and common sense from my dad that it was difficult to feel that i disagreed with his advice. having my friend there really helped and posts on tumblr that i relate to have also helped me feel that i am not alone. the internet has been very useful generally when looking for definitions of terms. i think that having more representation in the media would really help. i'm not saying that there aren't ace writers and actors and artists who can do this i just mean that groups and companies that are not solely ace need to get behind it too. i think that if i had been more aware of what asexuality was from a younger age i would not have worried so much or felt that i didn't fit in or couldn't find my identity. i also would not have worried about the fact that i would have to have sex someday because 'that's just what people do'. i also would perhaps not have been so quick to assume sometimes that i simply had more integrity than others my own age which was wrong of me. it would also be great if more forms had an asexual or at least an 'other, please specify' option and if it could be put forward as a valid option my formal government bodies. growing up i would have laughed and said 'of course not' if asked if i was asexual as i had only really heard the term in plant biology or in 'freaky' stories printed in trashy magazines. having it established as an official term would really help. ; i don't know if these really count as prejudice or discrimination exactly, i think it was just ignorance and privilege, so i didn't mention them above but there have been a few experiences which really affected me. the first one was when i was explaining to a colleague about my asexuality after i had mentioned casually i didn't want to have sex. the colleague was gay but was generally unaware of other saga identities or issues and hadn't heard of asexuality. another friend who had also perviously worked at the same place had come in to visit. as i was explaining to the first guy the second guy kept talking over me saying 'it just means she hasn't decided yet!'. he was generally quite an accepting person and seemed to be trying to simplify things for the first guy so initially i just tried to gently correct him saying 'well some people might see it like that but actually…' but he kept doing it again and again and the first guy was listening more to him than to me and it felt horrible like he was laying claim to my identity, like he was saying i was incapable of defining my own identity, like i was a child who'd got the wrong end of the stick and he was clearing up my misunderstanding. i eventually told him to stop and explained fully to the first guy but inside it had made me more angry than i realised at first. it was condescending and arrogant and dismissive and it made me feel shit. the second experience was when i was talking to a group of secondary school friends who i am still in touch with and see quite often. one girl who was always the one who was most aware of saga stuff when we were younger and had identified as bi since we were at school was talking about how annoying it was that people always thought bi people were just lying and were either actually straight but just saying they were bi to seem cool or actually gay but in denial. i agreed but then the whole group moved on the talk about a guy who we had gone to school with who had famously come out as bi in sixth from but then come out again as gay after school finished. the girl was saying 'it's people like him who give bi people a bad name'. i sympathised with her but suggested that perhaps he had not been entirely sure himself until later as working out your sexual orientation and shaking off heteronormativity can often be very confusing. she did not yet know at that point that i was asexual as she had been away for a long time in australia. she probably considered herself as the representative not straight person of our group. she said in a very condescending way that 'everyone knows really, some people are just in denial. but you do know. people definitely know.' i mentioned that i had read that many asexual people initially think that they may be gay before realising that they are asexual which was what had happened to me and came out to her at that point. she sort of agreed with me but kept saying that being asexual was different because you basically had to try out every type of person until you realised that you didn't like anyone. this is not the case and i felt affronted that she was pretending to know all about something when she didn't. also, although since discovering aro ace as a concept and beginning to identify as aro ace i have felt that i was these things all along, it took me a long time and lots of reading things online to come to this conclusion and discovering new names for things such as autochorissexuality still makes me see my own sexuality in a new light. i also think that it is possible for a person's sexuality to change although mine hasn't. i found her attitude elitist and unsympathetic, assuming that everyone's experience must be like hers. she is a good friend and i am happy to simply keep suggesting different viewpoints and hope they sink in but it made me very upset in the moment and reminded me that even within the wider saga community there are still prejudices, exclusion and elitism.\",\n",

i don\\'t know. i hope not. \\nthe final thing is more on going, and is in part because i have not come out to my family. i am a ciswoman, and there is this expectation that i will marry and have children in my family. everytime i interact with anyone in my family the conversation turns to whether i have a boyfriend yet, when i will marry, and what about kids. my adamant denial about all of this is ignored, pushed aside. i haven\\'t come out to them because i worry that my orientation will only increase their pressures.  i really need positivity, advice on relationships, and friendly jokes/puns. there\\'s a lot of quote \"ace discourse\" i see online, especially on tumblr, and seeing it is not in anyway healthy for me. i mean, too much of it can make me feel depressed for an entire week. and too often, the blogs engaging most actively with the ace community in positive ways are also those engaging most often with the negative discourse. it makes it very difficult to avoid what i don\\'t want to see and to find the positive posts that i would like. i would also like to see more resources for asexual and aromantic spectrum people in managing relationships - qpps, romantic, or sexual. that\\'s something i struggle with, and something i hear a lot of aces struggling with. and having help in figuring out what the feelings are and how to communicate with a partner beyond a simple \"it\\'s all up to you/you\\'ll know it when you feel it!\" would be wonderful.  understanding. respect. we are human, and sex does not make people human. i don\\'t want them to try to change us. i want them to include us as part of the lgbtq+ community. i want them to help bring awareness to our group - representation in media, education in sex ed - so that we aren\\'t considered broken. more importantly, so that people who are ace or aro do not think they are broken because they do not have the vocabulary to describe what they feel (or rather, do not feel). ; i mentioned above a lot of the negative things - the fear of coming out, the prejudice online, the ignorant comments offline. but i want to be clear that it hasn\\'t been all bad. despite living in the conservative american south, most people i\\'ve spoken to about my orientation not only know what it is, but are accepting and supportive. and i personally know three aces - and we didn\\'t meet through our sexual orientation, but only realized it long after our friendship began. i\\'ve made an embarrassing number of ace puns around my friends. realizing i am ace has been a blessing, really.

       " 'i used to be more open about my sexuality and would tell people i am ace, but i have faced enough discrimination and prejudice where i am wiser to not express it so openly. when i open up that i like girls (i am closeted about my gender, so others perceive me as female), i receive acceptance, but if i mention or even slightly allude to not being interested in sexual matters at all, then others get uncomfortable. on a good day, they will only ask invasive questions. other days, it could range from directly insulting me, dehumanizing me, or even range to thinly veiled rape threats. due to my experience with expressing my asexuality, not only do i not openly express it, but i also fear coming out of the closet about my gender and opening up about my sexual assault. the discrimination i have faced for my asexuality prohibit me from opening up about my other identities and past trauma.   i have been told before that i am ace because i \"haven\\'t been raped yet.\" when i thought i could trust my mother to come out to her, she insisted that something was wrong with me and she kept trying to set up doctor\\'s appointments to \"fix me.\" if i wasn\\'t already 18 at the time, she could\\'ve forced me to go to the doctors to \"cure\" my asexuality. when privately talking to friends on the train about my sexuality, a man from the other end of the train car started to scream sexually invasive questions to me... from the other end of the car... loud enough for everyone on the damn train car to hear him drilling these questions. when speaking with my (once) friend about my asexuality, he kept insisting how i was sexually abused as a child (i was) and kept asking questions regarding if i was (i never told him). at work, my coworkers have made inappropriate jokes regarding asexuality that has made me even more uncomfortable coming out. these are only a few that i will list. i have not requested any particular resources such as legal help, social work, home services, etc. as i have not felt like i have needed those as of yet, but in general in ace communities, i rely on general support of having a community. i feel like i can actually be my full self in ace communities and also, with so many varying ends of the ace and aro spectrum, it provides better education of other possibilities. even if they are not terms i would use, others could use them, and it pays to learn what one can. simply being there and being themselves is the greatest support i get as it helps with feeling like you are the only one going through it all.  the support i need from non-ace allies is that i need them to be more attentive to the discrimination against ace communities. helping to spread certain education regarding the orientation and the spectrum helps others that may be questioning and it also combats marginalization against us. ; ;',\n",
