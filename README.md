# Metis Projects

Metis is an immersive 12 week data science bootcamp in NYC focusing on machine learning,  statistical analysis, project design,
visualizations in Python, D3, and Flask.  

**Project 1: Exploring MTA Turnstile Data**
>Using the MTA publicly available subway turnstyle data we, in a team of four, analyzed and recommended subway stations to target for a street canvasing campaign.

**Project 2: Movie Series Analysis**
>Developed regression model to predict gross revenue, adjusted for inflation, with data scraped from IMDB using Scrapy. 

**Project 3: Correlates of War, Predicting Hostility Levels**
>Predicted hostility level of word wide disputes using a time series random forest classification model, with data from the Correlates of War.

**Project 4: Community Survey Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
>Natural Language Processing (NLP) on community survey long answer questions. Topic modeled with LDA and visualized in D3.js. Created Flask application to return similar words using word2vec. See first entree in Project section.

**Project 5: Predicting Likes on Instagram (ConvNet)**
>Built a computer vision, convolutional neural network (ConvNet & Deep Learning) to analyze picture quality and predict likes based on a user's historical photos. Classified quality of training set photos based on expected likes per user, while considering follower count. Scraped images and meta data using Scrapy.
